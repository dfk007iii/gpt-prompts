Please help me to learn kubernetes for my junior devops engineer job evaluation. I need to learn how kubernetes is setup and how to Create a Manifest file to create a Simple and Straight forward POD (Without replica and Scaling) and Build and Create POD from Manifest file.
And, also Quick Deployment of Docker Image with No Manifest . 

Help me to learn these concepts with free resources and where necessary provide code examples.
